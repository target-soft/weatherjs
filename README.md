# Parse a weather service

A simple coding exercise that will test if:
* you can code JavaScript
* you can create, open and parse an HTTP request
* you can parse response data to valid HTML


## Show weather data in a HTML file
---
### The HTML should display the following information:
  * Location (as Title)
  * Weather description
  * Temperature in degrees (e.g. 30Â°C)
  * Sunrise / sunset in UTC dateformat (e.g. Mittwoch, 10. Dezember 2018, 04:55:26)

#### Extend the MyWeather class and create some helper methods for better readability

## Show the result as an unsorted list with title or something similar like that, be creative!
---
    <body>
        <div>
            <Title>foo</Title>
            <List>
                <ListEl> Description: foo bar </ListEl>
                <ListEl> ... </ListEl>
                <ListEl> ... </ListEl>
            </List>
        </div>
    <body>

### *ADVANCED:* (Optional) You can use an HTML input field to enter the location and by pressing a button the result is rendered in the body (described above) 
---
        
## Calling the index.html the result should be visible if all inputs are correct implemented.
